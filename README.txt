Bullets vs Beelzebub is a top-down shooter where you play an angel rampaging through Hell, fighting off waves of demons. You begin the game equipped with an SMG (submachine gun) but can upgrade to a machine gun and minigun as the level progresses. When demons die they may drop hearts or souls, which restore your health or can be exchanged for upgrades respectively. After your score has reached 10,000 points, you must face the Demon Prince of Hell, Beelzebub. If you defeat Beelzebub, the true ending of the game is unlocked, and if you want to continue your rampage to max out your score you are free to do so. At the end of the game, your score will be uploaded to the leaderboards so you can measure your progress against other players.
